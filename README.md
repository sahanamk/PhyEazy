# PhyEazy
PhyEazy is a physics tutorial using python

Aim:
The project aims to provide tutorials on physics concepts for various age groups ranging from 12 – 17 years. This application shows pictorial and visual representation of the concepts to make it easier for students to learn.

Description:
Some aspects we have evolved in our project are
•	Elaborate and simple explanations
•	Visual representations of various experiments
•	Better understanding of various physics concepts

We have illustrated the physics concepts in step by step manner for broader understanding. This application gives broad explanations covering topics of each age ranging from 12 years that is class 7 to 17 years that is class 12.

Objective:
Many students find a hard time studying physics. Students also May not be able to imagine the various phenomenon. Such physics concepts are easier, interesting and fascinating to learn visually rather than learning from the books. PhyEazy is a good way to clear the difficult concepts and make physics interesting for children.
